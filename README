CBCKidsDB README

++ Installation:
    1) Install CodeIgniter www.codeigniter.com

    2) Configure a MySQL database per the schemata in the Design Document.  The 
       team makes the following recommendations:
        a) Name the database 'CBCKidsDB'
        b) Create an administrative user, with full permissions on that 
           database, called 'CBCKidsAdmin'.  This is to be used by the 
           administrator.
        c) Create an account with the minimum required permissions (SELECT, 
           INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on that database, called 'CBCKidsWeb'.  This 
           is to be used by the interface, and is the username to use in 
           step #7.

    3) Clone a copy of CBCKidsDB from 
       git://github.com/steven-nichols/COP4710-Group12.git 

    4) The 'models', 'views', 'controllers', and 'helpers' folders should be 
       copied into or symlinked from the 'CodeIgniter/application' folder 
       (overwrite the existing folders).

    5) The 'css', 'javascript', and 'pictures' folders should be copied into or 
       symlinked from the webserver document root.

    6) Configure 'index.php' in the webserver document root as appropriate for 
       how CodeIgniter was installed (usually application and system folder 
       paths and the 'ENVIRONMENT').

    7) Configure 'CodeIgniter/application/config/config.php'.  Defaults should
       be appropriate, with the following exceptions:
        a) Ensure that 'encryption_key' is set, it is required for session 
           control
        b) If logging is enabled it may be necessary to alter the permissions 
           on the folder so that the webserver can write to it.
        c) Set 'sess_use_database' to TRUE

    8) Configure CodeIgniter/application/config/database.php as required for 
       your database installation.  Use the database and user you created in
       step #2.

    9) Using phpMyAdmin, the command line, or another interface of your choice, 
       populate the database with the currently known users and inventory.

    10) Profit?
    
++ Notes
    1) Within the pictures folder are two folders called 'items' and 'users'. 
       Place the pictures of the items and users into these folders, 
       respectively.  Ensure that the filename matches what is in the DB, 
       correct one or the other if they are not.
